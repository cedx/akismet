# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **Akismet for JS**, you need to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), the Node.js package manager, up and running.

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands:

```shell
node --version
# v15.3.0

npm --version
# 7.0.14
```

?> If you plan to play with the package sources, you will also need [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell).

## Installing with npm package manager

### 1. Install it
From a command prompt, run:

```shell
npm install @cedx/akismet
```

### 2. Import it
Now in your [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) code, you can use:

```javascript
import * as akismet from "@cedx/akismet";
```
